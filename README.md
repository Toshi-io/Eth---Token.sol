# Eth-Token.sol
# Token

This Solidity program is a simple contract program that demonstrates how a token work. The purpose of this program is to learn the basic of how to mint and burn for beginners on the field. The program also makes use of conditional expressions to make sure that certain actions are only carried out when possible. It also enables the tracking of balances linked to certain addresses.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, for the purpose of building smart contracts on several blockchain systems, most notably Ethereum, Solidity is an object-oriented programming language. The contract is a beginner friendly in playing with how to mint and burn token and understand how it works. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., myToken.sol). Copy and paste the code in the myToken file together with this repository.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. This will open a new window that allows you to deploy the contract. Do not forget to select the “MyToken” contract before deploying.

In the deployment window “Deployed Contracts”, set the parameters for the balance, mint, and burn functions. 

To mint new tokens, input the address of the recipient and the number of tokens you want to mint and click transact.

To burn tokens, input the address of the recipient and the number of tokens you want to burn and click transact. 

To see current balances of the address, input the address of the recipient and the number of tokens you want to mint and click call. You can also see the total supply by clicking the “totalSupply” button.
